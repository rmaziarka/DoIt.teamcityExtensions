.SYNOPSIS
Starts the deployment process using configuration scripts residing in $DeployConfigurationPath.

.DESCRIPTION
It will deploy packages available in $PackagesPath to the $Environment, using configuration scripts at $DeployConfigurationPath.

.PARAMETER ProjectRootPath
Base directory of the project, relative to the directory where this script resides. It is used as a base directory for other directories.
  
.PARAMETER PSCILibraryPath
Base directory where PSCI library resides, relative to $ProjectRootPath.

.PARAMETER PackagesPath
Path to the directory where packages reside, relative to $ProjectRootPath.

.PARAMETER DeployConfigurationPath
Path to the directory where configuration files reside, relative to $ProjectRootPath. By default '$ProjectRootPath\deploy' or '$PackagesPath\DeployScripts\deploy'.

.PARAMETER Environment
Environment where the packages should be deployed (chooses ServerRoles / Tokens specified in the configuration scripts).

.PARAMETER TokensOverride
A hashtable containing tokens to override during this deployment. For example, if you don't want to store Live credentials in your configuration files,
you can pass them using this parameter. It should be a 'flat' hashtable containing only token names and their values (no categories).

.PARAMETER ServerRolesFilter
Allows to limit server roles to deploy.

.PARAMETER NodesFilter
List of Nodes where steps will be deployed - can be used if you don't want to deploy to all nodes defined in the configuration files.
If not set, steps will be deployed to all nodes according to the ServerRoles defined in the configuration files.

.PARAMETER StepsFilter
List of Steps to deploy - can be used if you don't want to deploy all steps defined in the configuration files.
If not set, steps will be deployed according to the ServerRoles defined in the configuration files.

.PARAMETER DeployType
Deployment type:
- All       - deploy everything according to configuration files (= Provision + Deploy)
- Provision - deploy only provisioning steps (-StepsProvision)
- Deploy    - deploy only deploy steps (-StepsDeploy / -Steps) 
- Adhoc     - deploy steps defined in $StepsFilter to server roles defined in $ServerRolesFilter and/or nodes defined in $NodesFilter
              (note the steps do not need to be defined in server roles)
