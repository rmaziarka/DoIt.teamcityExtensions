function Invoke-CopyUploadFilesMetaRunner {
    <#
	.SYNOPSIS
		A helper for TeamCity MetaRunner that uploads files.

	.PARAMETER Path
		The file or directory path that should be copied locally or uploaded to remote server.

    .PARAMETER ConnectionParams
        Connection parameters created by New-ConnectionParameters function.

	.PARAMETER Destination
		The path where the file will be saved to (must be directory).

    .PARAMETER Include
        The files to be included in copying.

    .PARAMETER Exclude
        The files to be excluded from copying.

    .PARAMETER CheckHashMode
        There are three modes for checking whether the destination path needs to be updated when uploading to remote server:
        DontCheckHash - files are always uploaded to the servers
        AlwaysCalculateHash - files are uploaded to the servers if their hashes calculated in local path and in remote path are different
        UseHashFile - files are uploaded to the servers if there doesn't exist a syncHash_<hash> file, where hash is hash calculated in local path

    .PARAMETER ClearDestination
        If $true then all content from $Destination will be deleted.

	.EXAMPLE			
        Invoke-CopyUploadFilesMetaRunner -Path c:\temp\test.exe -Destination c:\temp\ -ConnectionParams (New-ConnectionParameters -Nodes 'remote-server.com')
